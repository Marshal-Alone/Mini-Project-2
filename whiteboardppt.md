Introduction
This presentation provides an overview of the Collaborative Whiteboard project, focusing on the relevant literature, technology stack, and
potential applications. We explore the existing research on this emerging field and highlight its significance in today's digital landscape.
The Power of Digital Collaboration
• In today's digital era, effective
collaboration is the key to innovation and
productivity. The Collaborative Whiteboard
project leverages modern web
technologies to enable real-time
interaction.
Real-Time Interaction
• Our platform empowers every user to
draw, annotate, and share ideas
simultaneously, creating a truly
collaborative environment for remote
teams.
Beyond Traditional Tools
• Unlike traditional screen-sharing tools that
restrict participation, this interactive tool
enhances remote learning, brainstorming,
and creative design through a seamless,
intuitive interface.
