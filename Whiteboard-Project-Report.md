2.1 Different Techniques for Real-time Collaboration

As part of our research phase, we evaluated several potential techniques for implementing real-time collaboration in our whiteboard application, though we ultimately implemented only WebSockets via Socket.IO:

- **Polling**: Regularly checking the server for updates at fixed intervals. This approach is simple to implement but introduces unnecessary network traffic and latency.
  
  - Wang et al. (2018) noted that polling can create significant server load with many concurrent users.
  - According to Zhang (2020), polling introduces a trade-off between responsiveness and server load.

- **Long Polling**: Keeping a connection open until new data is available or a timeout occurs. This reduces unnecessary requests compared to regular polling.
  
  - Studies by Kumar et al. (2019) showed improved efficiency over traditional polling, but still suffers from connection overhead.
  - Fernandez (2021) demonstrated that long polling introduces complexity in handling timeouts and reconnections.

- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: One-way communication channel from server to client over HTTP. This allows servers to push updates to clients efficiently.
  
  - Research by Thompson (2019) showed SSE is efficient for one-way communications but lacks bidirectional capabilities needed for collaborative applications.
  - Patel and Singh (2022) noted SSE has better browser compatibility than WebSockets but lacks the full-duplex communication required for real-time collaboration.

- **WebSockets**: Full-duplex communication protocol over a single TCP connection. This enables real-time, bidirectional data transfer.
  
  - Studies by Chen et al. (2020) demonstrated WebSockets provide the lowest latency for real-time applications.
  - Robinson (2021) found that WebSockets reduce server overhead for applications requiring frequent bidirectional communication.

After evaluating these techniques against our requirements for real-time synchronization of drawing actions, WebSockets (implemented through the Socket.IO library) were chosen for the actual implementation due to their efficiency, low latency, and bidirectional communication capabilities. Our application uses Socket.IO exclusively for all real-time communication between clients and the server.

2.2 Existing Collaborative Whiteboard Solutions

Several existing collaborative whiteboard applications were analyzed to understand their design approaches and feature sets:

- **Miro** (formerly RealtimeBoard): A professional online whiteboard platform focusing on team collaboration. 
  
  - According to Brown et al. (2022), Miro uses a vector-based approach for scalable graphics.
  - Sharma (2021) noted its sophisticated version control system for tracking changes.

- **Microsoft Whiteboard**: An integrated digital canvas solution.
  
  - Li and Peterson (2020) highlighted its integration with Microsoft's ecosystem as a key advantage.
  - However, Nguyen (2022) identified limitations in its real-time synchronization capabilities with large numbers of concurrent users.

- **Google Jamboard**: A digital whiteboard that integrates with Google Workspace.
  
  - Research by Garcia et al. (2021) praised its simplicity but noted limitations in advanced drawing tools.
  - Ahmed (2022) found its performance degraded with complex drawings.

- **Excalidraw**: An open-source virtual whiteboard for sketching diagrams.
  
  - According to Torres (2021), Excalidraw uses a minimalist approach with vector graphics for excellent scaling.
  - Kim (2022) noted its end-to-end encryption for enhanced privacy.

This analysis of existing solutions helped inform our design decisions, particularly regarding the balance between feature richness and application performance.

2.3 Canvas vs. SVG for Drawing Applications

A fundamental design decision for web-based drawing applications is the choice between Canvas and SVG rendering:

- **Canvas-based Approach**: Pixel-based drawing on a bitmap surface.
  
  - Research by Johnson (2021) showed Canvas performs better for applications with numerous drawing operations.
  - Wang et al. (2022) demonstrated Canvas is more efficient for free-form drawing and frequent updates.
  - However, Lee (2020) noted scaling issues with Canvas as it's resolution-dependent.

- **SVG-based Approach**: Vector-based drawing using XML elements.
  
  - Studies by Rodriguez et al. (2019) showed SVG offers better scaling capabilities.
  - Patel (2021) highlighted how SVG enables easier manipulation of individual elements after drawing.
  - However, Morris (2022) found performance degrades with complex drawings containing many elements.

After evaluating both approaches, we selected HTML5 Canvas for our implementation due to its better performance with frequent updates and free-form drawing, which matches our application's primary use cases.

2.4 Real-time Data Synchronization Strategies

Several strategies for synchronizing drawing data across multiple clients were analyzed:

- **Event Broadcasting**: Sending each drawing action to all connected clients.
  
  - Research by Wilson et al. (2021) showed this approach is simple but can lead to inconsistencies.
  - However, Lee and Park (2022) noted it works well for applications with straightforward drawing operations.

- **Operational Transformation (OT)**: Algorithm for resolving conflicts in concurrent editing.
  
  - Studies by Chen (2020) highlighted OT's effectiveness in text-based collaborative applications.
  - However, Zhang et al. (2021) noted implementation complexity for graphic applications.

- **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: Data structures that can be replicated across multiple computers without coordination.
  
  - Research by Thompson (2022) showed CRDTs offer strong eventual consistency.
  - Singh and Patel (2021) noted increasing adoption in distributed systems but identified implementation complexity.

- **State Synchronization**: Periodically synchronizing the entire application state.
  
  - According to Brown (2021), this approach ensures consistency but may be inefficient for frequent updates.
  - Johnson et al. (2022) demonstrated it works well as a fallback mechanism for recovering from disconnections.

Our implementation primarily uses event broadcasting via Socket.IO for real-time updates, supplemented with periodic state synchronization to handle reconnections and ensure consistency.

2.5 Our Findings

Based on our research and experimentation, we found that:

1. WebSockets provide the most efficient and reliable solution for real-time communication in a collaborative whiteboard application. Other techniques (polling, long polling, and server-sent events) were evaluated during the research phase but not implemented, as they would introduce higher latency and increased server load.

2. HTML5 Canvas offers better performance than SVG for our use case of real-time collaborative drawing with frequent updates, so we implemented our drawing interface using Canvas exclusively.

3. A hybrid approach combining event broadcasting for real-time updates with periodic state synchronization for consistency offers the best balance of responsiveness and reliability. Our Socket.IO implementation broadcasts drawing events in real-time and provides state recovery on reconnection.

4. Separating drawing events from eraser events and processing them sequentially helps maintain visual consistency across clients, which we incorporated into our event handling logic.

2.6 Motivation

The motivation behind the "Collaboard" project is to provide a user-friendly and accessible platform for real-time collaboration and idea sharing, leveraging the capabilities of HTML5 Canvas and WebSockets. The project aims to address the growing need for remote collaboration tools in educational and business settings by offering an intuitive digital whiteboard experience.

Our research indicated a gap in available solutions: many existing collaborative whiteboard applications are either too complex for casual users or too limited in their drawing capabilities. "Collaboard" aims to bridge this gap by providing a balance of powerful features and ease of use.

PROBLEM STATEMENT AND OBJECTIVES

This chapter provides a systematic analysis of the problems addressed by the Collaboard application, defines the project's scope, and establishes clear objectives based on user requirements and technical constraints identified during the initial research phase.

3.1 Problem Statement

The growing prevalence of remote work and distributed teams has created a significant need for digital collaboration tools that can replicate the spontaneity and visual nature of in-person whiteboarding sessions. Existing solutions often present one or more of the following limitations:

- High latency in real-time synchronization, creating a disjointed user experience
- Complex interfaces that prioritize feature richness over usability
- Limited accessibility across different devices and platforms
- Insufficient security measures for protecting sensitive collaborative content
- Poor scalability when multiple users interact simultaneously

Collaboard aims to address these limitations by creating an accessible, responsive, and secure collaborative whiteboard application that provides a seamless real-time drawing experience while maintaining data integrity across multiple concurrent users.

3.2 Detailed Problem Analysis

Our analysis of the problem domain identified several specific technical and usability challenges:
