# Online Collaborative Whiteboard Requirements

## Project Overview

A real-time collaborative whiteboard web application that enables teams to brainstorm ideas, solve problems, and collaborate visually in a shared digital space. The platform supports multiple users working simultaneously on the same board, making it ideal for remote teams and distributed collaboration.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

After moving the files, we'll need to update the package.json to run both frontend and backend servers with 'nodemonstart' command.
